        <h2>Playing piano</h2>
        <p>Music has always been part of my life, and at some point of my childhood i really wanted to learn how to play the piano, but due to a lack of financial
          resorces i've never been introduced into this discipline. But in my years in high school i was so obsessed to have a piano that somehow i conviced my mother
          to by a very cheap one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then i started practicing alone trying to reproduce my favourite tracks of Ludovico Einaudi and Yann Tiersen, then i took some lesson, but the funny
          part is that the teacher followed my attitude to learn how to play by just playing, reading the music wasn't involved, so till now i'm not able to read a
          music sheet. But one day, when my main goals in life will be accomplished, i'm willing to learn how to read music once and for all.

        <h2>Mountain biking</h2>
        <div class="img-article"></div>
        <p>
          Cold, heat, wind, fatigue, bumpy roads, all this and much more are mountain biking to me. As well as my passion for airplanes,
          the one for mountain biking was born because compared to going on the road, mountain biking in the middle of the mountains in difficult roads is
          more complex, and this time also because the bike gives an exceptional sense of freedom. <br>
          Preparing to tackle the climb, having spare parts with you, greeting other cyclists as they come towards you and helping a
          cyclist who has experienced a puncture in his inner tube, make this sport a world apart where there are other unwritten social rules, better
          rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          All this translates into the ability to make friends with strangers (with whom you will tackle the next climbs), with surprising
          simplicity and ease. But the most beautiful thing about this sport is that if done in company your performance improves, where
          the limit is your own companion in adventures, therefore it is enough that one of the two wants to continue and encourages the
          other, and you will have no other choice than to overcome your own limits.
