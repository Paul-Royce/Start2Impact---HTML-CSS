        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! In this bio I prefer to avoid saying my abilities and skills right away, in my opinion you can really know someone
          through what he has to say. In addition to wanting to express my personality, in this bio i would also like to highlight the path
          that led me to programming.<br>
           Don't worry it won't take long!
        </p>
        <h2>MY PATH TO PROGRAMMING</h2>
        <p>
          My name is <strong>Paul</strong> i am 23 years old, i was born in Plaermo (Italy) but currently i live in Milan.<br>
          My journey into programming has his roots in my childhood. In fact, since i was a kid i was fascinated about
         <strong>complexity</strong>,
          especially when it had to do with the means of transport.<br>
          Growing up my love for complexity has grown even more when i fell in love with the airplanes systems
          (autopilot, automated safety measures, ecc), and all of this made me think that i should have become
          an airline pilot, not because i was interested in flying itself, but just for the sake of dealing with all those <strong>systems.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Depite this dream, things in my personal life have not turned out the way i hoped, making really difficult for me to archieve
          this goal. At the time i got really confused and angry ,but not all evil comes to harm. This state of confusion led me to a
          self development path, where i discovered other interests and <strong>passions</strong> such as: economy, finance, marketing, philosophy, investments
          and.....<strong>learning.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Especially the last one was a surprise because I didn't get along with it very well at high school. I guess it is due to
          the fact that in schools (at least the Italian ones) studying and learning are seen as an obligation, rather
          than as a way of feeding and satisfying <strong>curiosity</strong> at the same time, as well as a form of entertainment (at least to me).
        </p>
        <p>
          Above all these new interests, and despite not being able to become an airline pilot, for a variety of reasons, there was always a willingness of mine
          to deal with the complex, so after a period of time in which I explored the world of UX Design and Digital marketing thanks to <a href="https://www.start2impact.it/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Search_Brand&gclid=CjwKCAjwk6-LBhBZEiwAOUUDpxN1WsR7vKwi3OKQzzJMv_68eEKZBZmaBU0cDMK79FOkNqrOKmUBNBoCcMIQAvD_BwE">start2impact</a>, I finally landed
          in programming, where I re-discovered my passion for the complex and automatisms.
